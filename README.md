# Fractal Tree

This repository serves for introductory programming sessions at
[University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN) for high school students.

All you need to get started is to use the [begin](https://github.com/cesium/fractal-tree/tree/begin/begin) folder.
You may download it by clicking [here](https://goo.gl/hu1wJi). The goal is to
get something like what's inside the [end](https://github.com/cesium/fractal-tree/tree/master/end) folder.

This idea comes from the [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)
Youtube channel. You can watch and follow along the tutorial by clicking on the
